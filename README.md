### ***Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks***



##### This program allows you to look up a student's marks from a predefined dictionary.



##### How It Works

1. Stores Data: A dictionary named student\_marks holds the names and corresponding marks of several students.
   
   ---
2. Gets User Input: It prompts the user to enter a student's name. The input is cleaned up by removing extra spaces and capitalizing the first letter of each word.
   
   ---
3. ###### Finds and Displays Marks:

###### &nbsp;                        If the entered name exists in the dictionary, the program prints the student's name and their marks.

###### &nbsp;                        If the name is not found, it displays a "Student not found" message.





### ***Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing*** 

##### 

##### This program demonstrates how to extract and manipulate elements from a list.

##### 

##### ***How It Works***

1. Creates a List: It starts by creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
   
   ---
2. Extracts a Subset: It uses list slicing (\[0:5]) to select the first five elements from the original list.
   
   ---
3. Reverses the Subset: It then reverses the order of these five extracted elements using slice notation with a step of -1 (\[::-1]).
   
   ---
4. ###### Prints Results: The program prints the original list, the extracted elements, and the final reversed list
